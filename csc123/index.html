  <h3> Driveline Types</h3>
  <div id='drivelinePieChart'></div>

  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="figure">
  <h4> Figure Insights</h4>
  <p> With our dataset, you can see that of the different drivelines, "All-Wheel Drive" cars are the least common type. In addition, the "Front-Wheel Drive" and the "Rear-Wheel Drive" areas look similar, but the "Rear-Wheel Drive" portion is slightly bigger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
  <h4> Code Insights</h4>
  <p> For our code, we had a loop that for everytime it saw the different driveline types listed in the JSON file, it added one to its cumulative total.</p>

  <h3>City and Highway MPG Comparison</h3>
  <div id= 'makesCompareAvgMakesChart'></div>
  <div id= 'makesCompareAvgMakesChart2'></div>
  
  <div class="grid-container">
    
    <div class="figure">
  <h4> Figure Insights</h4>
  <p> Based on our bar chart, it can be said that the average highway MPG for all makes is greater than its city MPG. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="code">
  <h4> Code Insights</h4>
  <p> For our code, we had each make's city mpg values added up altogether and then took the average for it. The same process was done for the highway mpg values and average. In order to do this, we had to create an array with all the makes listed in the dataset that our code filtered and mapped through.</p>
  <p>For easy viewing, we've split up the full chart into two to make the content of the figure not so wide.</p>

  <h3> City and Highway MPG Relation to Fuel Type</h3>
  <div id= 'fuelScatterChart'></div>
  <div class="grid-container">
    
    <div class="figure">
  <h4> Figure Insights</h4>
  <p> Based on a look at this colored scatter plot, most of the vehicles in this dataset are all in one central area between the 0-50 mpgs. There however appears to be an outlier that runs on compressed natural gas and strays away from the main group of scattered points. </p>
    <p>Most of these vehicles run on gasoline. Vehicles running on E85 looks to have lower city and highway mpg's while vehicles running on diesel are higher in both aspects. </p>

  <p>Our code's dataset comes from the <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/cars/"> CORGIS Datasets Project.</a> The JSON file can be seen <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/json/cars/cars.json"> here</a> for review. </p>
